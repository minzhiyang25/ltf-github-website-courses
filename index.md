Workshop: Git for course deployment and websites
================================================

November 18, 2019

The Git repository for this workshop is here:
<https://github.com/massma/ltf-github-website-courses>

Learning objectives
-------------------

Attendees will learn:

-   How to use Git to manage projects
-   How to publish a website using Github
-   How to manage content with simple Markdown text files
-   How simple text files and Git ease collaboration and
    rapid development
-   How we can automatically generate websites, documents, and
    presentations from simple text files
-   The pros and cons of using Git as a tool to manage, organize, and
    collaborate on the deployment of courses

Lectures and slides
-------------------

-   [Introduction to Git and
    Github](lectures/git-github/intro-git-github.html) : tools to
    collaborate and update content.
-   [Using pandoc to automatically generate websites, presentations, and
    notes](lectures/pandoc-website/generate-materials.html) : convert
    simple, portable, and accessible text formats like Markdown to
    "prettier" representations.

Instructions for contributing
-----------------------------

Only modify the markdown (`.md`) files, not the html or any other files.

Post-event survey
-----------------

Please fill out this
[survey](https://columbiactl.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0GtCnIhJRtbHx7D)
after the event. This is my first time doing this, so feedback both
helps improve and helps the CTL improve the Lead Teaching Fellowship
program and support.

Resources
---------

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) : version control software that manages
    projects and allows many people to contribute to a project.
-   [Github](https://github.com/) : a Microsoft-owned web platform that
    hosts Git-managed projects and provides tools for users to raise
    issues and questions on projects and merge their own changes to
    a project.
-   [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) : a simple plain
    text document format that is very portable and easy to modify.
-   [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) : tool to convert to and from many
    file formats. For example, it can generate PDFs, websites, and
    presentations from Markdown text files.

### Tools to automate content generation; e.g. "build tools" (these might be OS-specific)

1.  GNU/Linux and Mac OSX

    -   [Gnu Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) : simple tool
        that automatically detects changes in source materials and
        re-compiles dependencies. In our examples, this involves
        automatically "compiling" websites and presentations using
        Pandoc whenever there are changes to the Markdown files.

2.  Windows

    -   **Any help from Windows users on what is used?** Could install
        `make` with Cygwin, but seems overly complicated.

### Alternatives

-   [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) : an alternative to
    Microsoft's Github. A (possibly biased) comparison with Github is
    available on [Gitlab's
    website](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html).
-   [Shake](https://shakebuild.com/) : an alternative build system to
    Make with a little bit more of a learning curve but with more
    features and the benefits of access to a full programming language
    in Haskell. I (Adam) use this primarily, mostly because I use
    Haskell primarily. Many other languages also have build systems, and
    it can be beneficial to use a build system embedded in the language
    you prefer (e.g. [SCons](https://scons.org/) in Python,
    [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) in Ruby).
-   [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) - an alternative to Markdown with
    advanced personal organizational tools integrated into the Emacs
    text editor.

Tutorials
---------

-   [Github guides](https://guides.github.com/) - collection of useful
    guides, some of which linked below.
-   [Github Hello
    World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) :
    introduction to Github, and no text editor even required!
-   [Mastering
    Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) :
    Github introduction to Markdown format.
-   [Git tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) : in depth
    introduction to Git
-   [Pandoc Getting Started](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html) :
    very thorough and accessible introduction to using Pandoc.
-   [Try Pandoc Online](https://pandoc.org/try/) : simple web
    application that lets you convert text between many formats. Also
    shows the corresponding Pandoc command for each conversion.

The [Center for Teaching and learning](https://ctl.columbia.edu/) (CTL) and this workshop
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This event is sponsored by the **Lead Teaching Fellowship**, which is a
professional development program for graduate students at Columbia
University committed to advancing pedagogy.

The CTL has a lot of great programming that I would recommend for anyone
interested in teaching. Specific for doctoral students, there is the
[CTL Teaching Development
Program](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/programs-for-graduate-students/ctl-teaching-development-program/),
the [Lead Teaching
Fellowship](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/lead-teaching-fellows/)
(sponsored this event), the [Teaching Observation
Fellowship](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-observation-fellows/),
and [Teaching Assessment
Fellowship](https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/opportunities-for-graduate-students/teaching-assessment-fellows/).
If you are interested in any of the fellowships, I think enrollment in
the Teaching Development Program would strengthen your application.
